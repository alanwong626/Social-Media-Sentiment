The aim of this project is to build a reddit r/WallStreetBet sentiment tracker based on the stock tickers mentioned. The project will later expand to google news articles, twitter and other social media platforms.

The main idea is that the data will be updated every five minutes, and pass the data to a sentiment caculator. The workflow will be managed using airflow. (Other potenial technologies, Kafka, MongoDB, elastic search...)
